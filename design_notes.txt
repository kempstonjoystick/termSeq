Linux Text Sequencer:

Following framework:

(1) 
 - One thread per track. 
 - Thread reads data from that uses array of file descriptors, indexed by track. 
 - Thread runs in interval loop, Each thread is synchronized (polls some shared resource)
 - When thread wakes, it knows which interval and beat it is on (shared across all threads)
 - plays sample if needed
 - Use libsdl: http://wiki.libsdl.org/Introduction
 
(2) 
 - tempo thread is responsible for waking up the other threads depending on tempo.
 - Maintains a task list (basically all the top level sequencing data, number of bars etc.
 - This can display scrolling playback data too
 - UI looks like the guitar-hero pattern - tracks listed right to left,
 
(3) Main thread maintains a command listener interface. Uses dbus or posix message queues to send 
commands. 
 - Need to define some sort of control protocol

(4) User issues termSeq commands to control tracks
 - allows them to script sequence changes
